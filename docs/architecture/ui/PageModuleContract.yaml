name: Page Module Contract
type: UI Architecture Invariant
location:
  - resources/js/app.js
  - resources/js/pages/**
  - resources/views/**
purpose: Define the framework-agnostic, page-scoped UI module contract that eliminates executable Blade JavaScript and guarantees deterministic Alpine initialization.
when_to_use:
  - Building or migrating any interactive Blade page to the page-module pattern
  - Adding new UI behavior that depends on Alpine state or fetch-based CRUD
  - Reviewing PRs that touch interactive Blade + JavaScript integration
when_not_to_use:
  - Static Blade pages with no interactivity
  - Purely presentational Blade partials that emit events only
  - Backend-only changes with no UI behavior impact
rules:
  - Every interactive page must have exactly one page root element with data-page and data-payload attributes.
  - Every interactive page must include exactly one payload script tag with type application/json and an id matching data-payload.
  - Blade templates must contain no executable JavaScript.
  - The only allowed script tag in Blade is a payload block: <script type="application/json">.
  - All page UI logic must live in resources/js/pages/**.
  - Each page module must export a mount(rootEl, payload) function.
  - Page modules must register Alpine components inside mount using Alpine.data('ComponentName', ...).
  - Alpine.start() must run exactly once and only after the page module has mounted when data-page is present.
  - Page module loading must be build-safe and not rely on unbounded dynamic imports; the loader must resolve known modules (e.g., via import.meta.glob).
  - No global JavaScript state may be introduced to implement this pattern.
  - Payload parsing must be safe (JSON parse with fallback to an empty object).
  - Page modules must avoid build-invalid syntax such as optional chaining on assignment LHS.

example_usage: |
  Blade:
    <script type="application/json" id="materials-index-payload">@json($payload)</script>
    <div data-page="materials-index" data-payload="materials-index-payload" x-data="materialsIndex"></div>

  Make Orders (persisted):
    <script type="application/json" id="manufacturing-make-orders-payload">@json($payload)</script>
    <div data-page="manufacturing-make-orders" data-payload="manufacturing-make-orders-payload" x-data="manufacturingMakeOrders"></div>

  Page module:
    // resources/js/pages/materials-index.js
    export function mount(rootEl, payload) {
      Alpine.data('materialsIndex', () => ({ /* state + methods */ }));
    }

    // resources/js/pages/manufacturing-make-orders.js
    // Payload includes: make_orders[], recipes[], can_execute, store_url, schedule_url_base, make_url_base.
    // Actions: create (store), schedule, make with JSON responses and toasts on success/error.

  App loader:
    // resources/js/app.js loads ./pages/${slug}.js, calls mount(rootEl, payload), then Alpine.start() once.
